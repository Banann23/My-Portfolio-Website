<h1> 💻 Hubert Banach – Portfolio Website <h1>
<hr>

    This repo contains my personal portfolio — a clean, modern, fully responsive website built with React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    It’s my digital space where I showcase who I am, what I build, and how I work.

    The site uses subtle motion, soft transitions using Framer Motion, and a slight retro-inspired style to give it a unique feel without overdoing it.
