# 💻 Hubert Banach – Portfolio Website
---

This repo contains my personal portfolio — a clean, modern, fully responsive website built with React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It’s my digital space where I showcase who I am, what I build, and how I work.

The site uses subtle motion, soft transitions using **Framer Motion**, and a light, minimalistic style to give it a unique feel without overdoing it. The website supports both **English and Polish**, allowing users to switch between languages seamlessly.
